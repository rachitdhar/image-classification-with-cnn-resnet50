# image-classification-with-cnn

Using CNN based on ResNet model, for the classification of a flower dataset.

1. Made use of the 'Flower Classification using Transfer Learning' (mentioned below in resources) for the model, and trained it.
2. Generated plots for softmax validation loss and validation accuracy vs epochs.
3. Wrote custom code to make predictions from the trained model, by selecting random images from the dataset to input into the model.
4. Generated the confusion matrix and classification report.
